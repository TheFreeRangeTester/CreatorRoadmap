You are a senior full-stack engineer and product-minded architect working inside this repository.

Goal:
Design and plan the implementation of a Premium feature: a YouTube Opportunity Scoring system that enriches existing Fanlist ideas with YouTube market demand signals.

Product intent:
Fanlist already captures what the audience wants (votes on ideas).
This Premium feature adds the “market side” by using public YouTube data to help creators decide which ideas are likely to perform well in terms of reach and organic discovery.

This is NOT about predicting virality or using opaque AI models.
This is about pragmatic, explainable signals based on YouTube Data API v3.

Important:
- This is a Premium-only feature
- The repository already contains logic to differentiate Free vs Premium features
- Your plan must explicitly integrate with that existing Premium gating logic (backend + UI)

Before answering:
- Inspect the repository structure
- Identify existing models, API routes, background jobs and Premium gating mechanisms
- Reuse existing conventions instead of inventing parallel systems

What to produce:
A concrete, step-by-step implementation plan to add YouTube data ingestion, scoring, storage and UI surfacing for Premium users only.

The plan must include:

1. YouTube data sources
- Which YouTube Data API v3 endpoints to use
- What fields are realistically available and useful
- Explicitly list what data cannot be obtained and must not be implied in UX

2. Data ingestion & lifecycle (Premium-aware)
- When YouTube data should be fetched (idea creation, async job, scheduled refresh, manual re-sync)
- How to prevent unnecessary API calls for Free users
- How to implement this using existing backend patterns in the repo
- Caching strategy and snapshotting
- Handling API quotas, retries and partial failures

3. Scoring model (core of the feature)
- Define a deterministic, explainable scoring model
- Suggested inputs:
  - Number of recent videos matching the idea keyword
  - Average and median views
  - Views per day (velocity)
  - Channel size normalization (views vs subscribers)
- Outputs must be human-friendly labels, not raw numbers:
  - YouTube Demand: Low / Medium / High
  - Competition: Low / Medium / High
  - Overall Opportunity: Weak / Good / Strong
- Provide example formulas or pseudocode
- Explain why each signal matters
- Scores should only be computed and stored for Premium users

4. Combining Fanlist signals with YouTube signals
- How to combine existing Fanlist votes with YouTube opportunity scores
- Suggested composite classifications, e.g.:
  - Audience-Led
  - Market-Led
  - Balanced Opportunity
- How these composites are exposed only to Premium users

5. Database changes
- Tables or columns needed to store YouTube snapshots and scores
- How to associate stored data with Premium access (user, workspace or subscription)
- How often data should be refreshed
- How historical snapshots could be reused later (trend detection, alerts)

6. UI / UX surfacing (Premium UX)
- What information should appear on an idea card or idea detail page for Premium users
- How Free users should see this feature (locked state, teaser, upsell)
- Suggested copy for locked states, tooltips and disclaimers
- Visual hierarchy: what matters most for creator decisions

7. MVP vs future iterations
- Clearly define what is required for a Premium MVP
- Explicitly list what should be deferred to Phase 2+ (trend alerts, idea suggestions, notifications, benchmarking, etc.)

Constraints:
- Respect YouTube API quota limits
- Avoid ML unless strictly necessary
- Prefer deterministic logic over “AI magic”
- Assume a small team / solo maintainer
- Optimize for maintainability and cost control

Output format:
- Clear sections
- Concrete technical decisions
- Actionable steps that can be converted into tickets
- No marketing fluff or generic explanations

Think like someone who has to build, ship, gate, and maintain this Premium feature in production.
